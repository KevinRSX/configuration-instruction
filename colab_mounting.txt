Mount Google Drive:
>>> from google.colab import drive
>>> drive.mount('/content/gdrive')

Update Drive Path:
>>> import sys
>>> sys.path.append('/content/gdrive/My Drive')

If there is a direct child in My Drive named x.py, you may import it with:
>>> import x

The appended system path can be set to any directory in the Google Drive folders, which will be the workspace.

To pass the authentication, make sure the following:
 - Direct children (files/folders) to my drive should be as few as possible
 - Empty the trash
 - Authentication code should be copied by selecting the text manually from the popped out browser tab. Coping by clicking the "copy" button might result in timeout.
